    <h2 class="h3 mb-3">2.1. Front-End Development</h2>
    <p class="lead">Front-end development, also known as client-side development, involves creating everything that users see and interact with in their web browsers.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):</strong> The standard markup language for creating web pages. It structures the content on the web.</li>
      <li><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong> A language used to style the HTML content, including layouts, colors, and fonts.</li>
      <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> A scripting language used to create dynamic content that can change without reloading the page.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> When you visit a website and see a button that changes color when you hover over it, that’s front-end development at work.</p>

  <section id="backend-development" class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="h3 mb-3">2.2. Back-End Development</h2>
    <p class="lead">Back-end development, also known as server-side development, is concerned with what happens behind the scenes.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Server:</strong> A system that processes requests and delivers data to the client (browser).</li>
      <li><strong>Database:</strong> Stores and retrieves data that is displayed on the website.</li>
      <li><strong>Application Logic:</strong> The programming that processes inputs, interacts with the database, and returns outputs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> When you log into a website and your personal data is retrieved and displayed, that’s back-end development at work.</p>
